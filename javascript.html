        <h2>Javascript basics</h2>
        <p>
          Ayyy mamia lots of stuff to do and all the other things rather than other thing
          but rather than do all those other things i shall do this as well also welcome to Javascript
          Javascript lives under a host of environments so remmeber to thank your local javascript person!
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Variable Declaration</a> ayyy so this sentence only contains one
          special variable so it is here now! <b>var x</b>this is the amazing bold text that we will use in this here paper.
          and yes i am writing these paragraphs to take up similar room to the given examples
          </p></li>
          <li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Variable Assignment</a>
         this sentence also contains one other
            variable and here it is! <b>var x =10</b> So it turns out i under wrote this paragrapg so guess what? I shall rewrite this shin
            dig to add more characters to this thing yoooo!
          </p></li>
          <li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Data type</a>
          Data types are an important conept; to be able to operate on variables you
          need to know the data type. There are six data types that are the java
          script primitives. Boolean <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>;null - <b>null</b>
          aka nothing; Number <b>42</b> or <b>3.145432;</b> String- <b>"Coding dojo rocks!;"</b>
          Array <b>[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo'];</b> and object - <b>{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</b>
          </p></li>
          <li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Conditionals</a>
         when you write code you want to perform diffrent decisions - hitting diffrent code blocks
          hitting values or conditionna that have benn met so the other day there other things that require other things
          and those things are what they are known as ayyy. we have these things called <b>if</b> these things are conditionals
          we write if conditionals to set parademers to see if it passses the condition we put. <b>else if</b> are another part that follows up the if field we set
          </p></li>
          <li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Loops</a>
         There are many diffrent kinds of loop in every programming language, but they all do the same thing;
          they will repeat the values or the conditions alot of times. Well you run around the tracks there will be a hella lot of solutions son
          </p></li>
          <li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/">Function</a> Functions A function expression is similar to and has the same syntax as a function declaration (see function expression for details).
            A function expression may be a part of a larger expression. One can define "named" function expressions (where the name of the expression might be used in the
            call stack for example) or "anonymous" function expressions. Function expressions are not hoisted onto the beginning of the scope, therefore they cannot be used
             before they appear in the code.
